Will we never know of freedom?
NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
(Fire)

So now it's my turn
The leading batter!
No room for failure
Not here in my world
I gotta cut the fuse before it burns us all
(It's on fire)

No God has ever answered my words
But it don't matter
I still got hope and that's all I could really ask for
I gotta shake the fear so I can keep on running forward
(It's on fire)

I wish I could forget
The memories that cut deepest
'Cause I have found our path is shared by both Heaven and Hell
It only takes a spark
For a fire to start
Won't hesitate, we'll fan the flames
That is the way we'll make our own future!
(I'm) Gonna reach that finish line (YEAH!)
Even if inches at a time (YEAH!)
I'll keep going, nothing can stop me
NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
They say that we're not strong enough
But I am never givin' up
And I'll leave this future behind me
I will keep going nothing can stop me
NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
